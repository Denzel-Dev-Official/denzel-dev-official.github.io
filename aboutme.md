Hi! I’m a backend developer passionate about building systems that solve real-world problems with technical elegance.

I currently collaborate with **[Lombao Estudios](https://www.lombaoestudios.com/)** on **[A Ver Que Sale](https://www.averquesale.com/)**, a price-comparison platform that helps consumers find the most affordable and relevant products using intelligent search technology.

My focus lies in:
- Designing **robust and efficient RESTful APIs** with **Python** and **Flask**
- Implementing **search engines** with **Elasticsearch** to prioritize useful and budget-friendly results
- Ensuring **scalability**, **performance**, and **security** in backend systems

Although my expertise is backend-oriented, I deeply value clean architecture and cross-functional collaboration to deliver real user value.

When I’m not coding, I explore cybersecurity techniques, experiment with audio effects (yes, the Haas effect is fascinating!), or refine my async development workflows.
